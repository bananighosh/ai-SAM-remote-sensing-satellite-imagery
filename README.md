# Segment Anything Model for Remote Sensing Applications
A computer vision based winter internship project under the supervision of Prof Pantelis Monogioudis

Lately, we have observed the advent of very large foundational models in NLP applications - sometimes these models result in  hundreds of billions of parameters - for example the [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) model that has 175 billion parameters. 

In this project you will be asked to explore the analogous solution for computer vision. We will use the  Segmenting Anything Model (SAM) to segment sidewalks and other features from satellite imagery (remote sensing).

## Background

Read and experiment with [the SAM implementation](https://segment-anything.com/) and [the SAM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04703).
